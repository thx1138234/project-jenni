## [Unreleased] — Phase 1 In Progress

### Added — IPEDS full build, all years 2000–2024 (March 2026)
- Full project structure migrated to `~/claude/projects/project-jenni/`
- `schema/ipeds_schema.sql` — all 9 tables + 4 analytical views
- `ingestion/ipeds/downloader.py` — NCES bulk file fetcher with manifest tracking
- `ingestion/ipeds/loader.py` — full component loader (IC, ADM, EF, C, GR, SFA, F, HR, INST)

#### Final row counts (all years loaded):

| Table | Rows | Year Range | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `institution_master` | 13,609 institutions | — | HD source; 2000/2001 = stubs only (no HD on NCES) |
| `ipeds_ic` | 174,441 | 2000–2024 | IC + IC_AY merged per year |
| `ipeds_adm` | 20,571 | 2014–2023 | ADM standalone from 2014 only |
| `ipeds_ef` | 160,861 | 2000–2023 | enrtot NULL for 2000/2001 (old EF format, see known issues) |
| `ipeds_completions` | 5,911,068 | 2000–2024 | |
| `ipeds_gr` | 106,234 | 2000–2023 | |
| `ipeds_sfa` | 139,781 | 2001–2022 | AY 2023-24 not yet released |
| `ipeds_finance` | 87,020 | 2000–2022 | 43,510 FASB + 43,510 GASB; AY 2023-24 not yet released |
| `ipeds_hr` | 46,768 | 2012–2023 | HR files start 2012 on NCES |
| **Total** | **6,660,353** | | |

- IPEDS 2022 & 2023 initial build (before full range):
  - `institution_master`: 6,349 institutions (HD source, includes EIN + OPEID)
  - `ipeds_ic`: 12,187 rows (merged IC + IC_AY per year)
  - `ipeds_adm`: 3,963 rows
  - `ipeds_ef`: 11,353 rows
  - `ipeds_completions`: 561,828 rows
  - `ipeds_gr`: 7,510 rows
  - `ipeds_sfa`: 5,653 rows (2022 only — AY 2023-24 not yet released)
  - `ipeds_finance`: 3,832 rows — 1,916 FASB + 1,916 GASB (see note below)
  - `ipeds_hr`: 7,142 rows

### Decisions & Clarifications
- **GASB finance data loaded alongside FASB** — the original deferral policy
  (FASB-only) was never enforced in `FinanceLoader`; `_load_gasb()` runs
  unconditionally. Both F1A and F2 rows loaded cleanly and are correctly labeled
  with `reporting_framework`. Decision: accept both as loaded. The cross-sector
  comparison warnings in `docs/gasb_fasb_crosswalk.md` still apply.
  CLAUDE.md updated to reflect actual state.

### Fixed — Finance field mapping (March 2026)
- **FASB expense subtotals and net assets corrected**: F2E expense columns use
  3-digit suffixes (`f2e011`…`f2e121`), not the 2-digit names previously mapped.
  `exp_total` fixed to `f2b02`; `netassets_total` fixed to `f2b07`. Full reload.
- **GASB revenue, expenses, and net position corrected**: `rev_total` was mapping
  to `f1c02`/`f1b17` (wrong lines); fixed to `f1b25` (total operating revenues) with
  `f1d01` fallback. Expense subtotals were mapped to F1D01–F1D06 (income statement
  totals), not functional categories; fixed to F1C011–F1C191. `netassets_total`
  fixed to `f1a18` (ending net position). `rev_state_approp` added (`f1b19`).
  Full reload.
- **find_csv fallback fixed**: fallback to first CSV alphabetically only fires when
  no pattern hints are provided. Previously caused year-2000 GASB slot to load the
  FASB file (no F1A file exists for 2000), creating 1,895 bad GASB rows. Fixed.
- **Finance integrity test updated**: GASB/FASB equality check replaced with
  "both present" check (equality was an artifact of the filename bug).
  `EF_ENRTOT_NULL_KNOWN_YEARS` extended to 2000–2007. `VALIDATION_FINANCE_YEAR`
  set to 2016 (most recent year all five validation institutions reported).

#### Stratified spot check — 10 institutions, survey_year 2022 (March 2026)
All 10 institutions confirmed clean after Finance field mapping fixes:

| Institution | Type | FW | rev_total | exp_total | netassets | tuition |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Univ of Colorado Colorado Springs | Public R2 | GASB | $259.7M | $258.9M | $270.0M | $111.5M |
| Prairie View A&M University | Public R2 / HBCU | GASB | $343.4M | $301.2M | $768.0M | $58.7M |
| Boston University | Private NP R1 | FASB | $2,836.2M | $2,421.6M | $5,652.3M | $1,343.9M |
| Harvard University | Private NP R1 | FASB | $6,159.9M | $5,911.8M | $61,519.5M | $1,110.3M |
| Claremont McKenna College | Private NP Lib Arts | FASB | $196.2M | $170.7M | $1,778.2M | $52.5M |
| Wheaton College (IL) | Private NP Lib Arts | FASB | $178.6M | $134.6M | $862.5M | $55.4M |
| Gonzaga University | Private NP Masters | FASB | $271.0M | $280.0M | $744.2M | $181.5M |
| Robert Morris University | Private NP Masters | FASB | $109.8M | $120.3M | $143.5M | $59.3M |
| Lone Star College System | Community College | GASB | $625.1M | $537.3M | $384.5M | $53.6M |
| Spelman College | HBCU Lib Arts | FASB | $187.9M | $138.3M | $798.9M | $46.8M |

- All `reporting_framework` labels match control type (public=GASB, private NP=FASB)
- UCCS $259.7M and Prairie View $343.4M match post-fix expected values exactly
- No negative values, no implausible outliers
- `tests/test_schema_integrity.py` passes: 0 failures, 3 warnings (EF NULL enrtot
  2008/2010/2020 all ≤0.09%, within 1% threshold)

### Fixed — EF loader and room & board (March 2026)
- **EF enrollment totals now correct**: `_load_part_a` was filtering on
  `lstudy in ("", "1")` which missed the all-student aggregate row
  (`efalevel=1`, `lstudy=4`). Fixed to index Part A rows by `efalevel` and
  pull totals from `efalevel=1` (all students), `efalevel=2` (undergrad),
  `efalevel=12` (grad). Also discovered Part D (`ef{year}d.csv`) contains
  retention/cohort data, not enrollment totals — enrollment lives in Part A.
  Part A now uses UPDATE instead of INSERT OR REPLACE to preserve `stufacr`
  from Part D without clobbering it. EF reloaded for 2022 & 2023.
  Babson confirmed: enrtot=3,989 (2022), enrtot=3,943 (2023).
- **Room & board now room + board**: `roomboard_oncampus` was mapping to
  `chg4ay0` (room charge only). Fixed to sum `chg4ay0` + `chg5ay0` (board).
  Babson confirmed: $17,920 (2022), $18,852 (2023).

### Known Issues (open)
- **EF enrollment NULL for 2000/2001**: Pre-2002 IPEDS EF Part A files use
  `line`/`section` column layout instead of the modern `efalevel` column.
  The loader expects `efalevel` and finds no matching rows; `enrtot`,
  `enrugrd`, and `enrgrad` are NULL for all 2000 and 2001 institutions.
  EF-D rows exist (6,083 for 2000; 6,560 for 2001) but enrollment totals
  are unpopulated. Race/ethnicity columns also unresolved for these years.
  Fix requires reverse-engineering the old EF Part A format mapping.
- **HR full professors field**: `sisprof` may be 0 for institutions that classify
  faculty without academic rank (e.g., Babson). Needs verification against a
  school with traditional faculty rank structure before trusting HR rank data.
- **SFA/Finance 2023 not available**: AY 2023-24 NCES files not yet released
  as of March 2026.
- **HR starts 2012**: `S{year}_SIS.zip` files do not appear on NCES before
  2012. `ipeds_hr` has no coverage for 2000–2011.
